# PS_Remote_Desktop_Launcher

For our Microsoft Software and Server Academy (Server and Cloud Administrator), we use a service that provides three virtual machines on Azure that we can then Remote Desktop into for lab work.  

This GUI-Enhanced PowerShell script gives an easy way to remember those ip addresses and provide a quick way to connect to each of the computers as they are restarted (quite often) in the process of the lab.

When "Done" is clicked, the script removes the ".rdp" files it created to launch each connection.
